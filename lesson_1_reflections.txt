The + and - signs made finding the diff quite easy
It's intuitive to know that plus means it is something new
minus symbol means the new file is missing something
The less text per line, the easier it was to find the typo

Having access to the entire history allows you to:
find bugs
re-implement previous versions easily
re-implement parts of former versions

Pros of manually choice is that you get to deciden what works best for you
Cons - if you aren't disciplined or you are forgetful, you can get into trouble

Multiple file commits are helpful for saving related files, this is common in software development.
Git is a repository primary for use in software development and configuration management.

The use cases for tightly related files isn't common in this case.

git log can tell you when files were changed
git log will show you the commit message as well to know if that commit is what you are looking for
git diff helps you to see the specific change made from one commit to the next

you can be more confident that you can revert to a known good state if you break something
if you practice good discipline in how you commit, it should cut down troubleshooting time even more

I would like to begin using git to commit changes to gitHub
